## Source code for the pan Africa page

This supplementary repository contains the overall octopress source of the pan Africa page. It is a lot easier to clone this one and use rake rather than generating the static files [pan-africa.github.io](https://github.com/pan-Africa/pan-Africa.github.io) manually.

To proceed:
* clone the repository
* make changes: generate pages/posts, change layouts and maybe even theme...
* rake deploy should push through the static files and those changes should be automatically reflected on the page [http://pan-africa.github.io](http://pan-africa.github.io)
* commit the changes on the branch source
* pull --rebase and push on the branch source... so that every one contributing can get the latest changes.

Don't forget to make small commits. It can be very hard to merge if there are too many files changed at once.
